# University & Bursary Application Conversational Chatbot

## Description
This project is an NLP-based conversational chatbot developed as part of my MSc in Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Nottingham. It helps South African learners navigate complex university and bursary applications, supporting students from under-resourced schools and addressing digital literacy barriers.

## Motivation
Many students struggle with university and bursary applications due to complex processes, limited digital literacy, and lack of guidance. This chatbot leverages AI and conversational interfaces to simplify information retrieval and guide users through applications**, making education more accessible and inclusive.

## Features
- Understands natural language inputs using cosine similarity for intent matching 
- Provides guidance for university and bursary application processes
- Ensures intuitive and clear conversational UX to reduce user confusion  
- Maintains clean, maintainable Python codebase with SQLite for data storage  
- Supports future extensions and AI-driven enhancements  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- NLP techniques (cosine similarity for intent matching)  
- SQLite for lightweight data storage  
- Clean code principles and maintainable architecture  

## Research & Methodology
- Designed and implemented chatbot as a practical solution for real-world community needs 
- Applied conversational UX principles to ensure natural, user-friendly interactions  
- Tested prototypes with sample users to validate clarity and effectiveness  
- Aligned design and functionality with Human-AI Interaction principles
